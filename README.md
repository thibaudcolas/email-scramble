## Getting Started

`email-scramble` uses a simple [ROT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) transformation. The default rotation is ROT-18: letters will be rotated by 13 and numbers by 5.

```js
var encodedEmail = emailScramble.encode('mail@example.com');
var decodedMail = emailScramble.decode(encodedMail);

// You can also pick any other flavor of ROT:
function myROT(str) {
  // Here letters are obfuscated with ROT-13 and numbers are kept clear.
  return emailScramble.rot(13, 0, str);
}

// Functional-programming partial application style:
var myRot = emailScramble.rot.bind(emailScramble, 13, 0);
```

Here is a real-world example:

```js
// <a href="znvygb:znvy@rknzcyr.pbz" data-email-scramble>Send me an email!</a>
var links = document.querySelectorAll('[data-email-scramble]');

links.forEach(function decodeLink(link) {
  link.href = emailScramble.decode(link.href);
});
```

### Download & import

`email-scramble` is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-scramble), or you can [download a ZIP](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/email-scramble/releases).

```
npm install --save email-scramble
```

This library can be used as an ES6 module, Node/Browserify CommonJS-like module, a RequireJS AMD module or a global:

```js
// ES6
import emailScramble from 'email-scramble';

// The CommonJS way.
var emailScramble = require('email-scramble');

// Global variable.
var emailScramble = window.emailScramble;
```
